# Prestige Urban

Welcome to Prestige Urban, a website project where users can buy clothes online. This project is part of my coursework as a software engineering student.

## Project Overview

Prestige Urban is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users. The website includes features such as:

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in functionality.
- **Product Catalog**: Browse a wide range of clothing items.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to your cart and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management**: Track orders and view order history.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Hosting**: [Your hosting service, if applicable]

## Privacy and Security Concerns

Before pushing the project to GitHub, it's essential to address some security and privacy concerns:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is not hard-coded into your project. Use environment variables and a `.env` file to manage these securely.

2. **`.gitignore` File**: Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files and directories from being tracked by Git. Common entries include:

    ```plaintext
    node_modules/
    .env
    ```

3. **API Security**: Review your API endpoints to ensure they are secure and do not expose sensitive data.

**Note**: We have not yet pushed the project to GitHub because we are currently securing our private data and ensuring the overall security of the project.

## Future Enhancements

- **Payment Integration**: Add secure payment processing using a service like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Enhanced User Profiles**: Allow users to save their favorite items and set preferences.
- **Search and Filter**: Implement advanced search and filtering options for the product catalog.
